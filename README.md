  <font face="Calibri"><b>Objective</b></font>
  <br>This project aims at sending bulk email using python so that any user home or office can use it for free. It is scalable to include more features like adding attachments and even sending emails with embedded images.<br>

  You need to run the bulkemail.py which contains the function where I have joined all other mini projects.
